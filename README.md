# Random Bouncing Ball Exercise

## Description

In this project, I've used JavaScript to create an area and boundry for three separate balls to bounce independently at different speeds and at random angles. The movement patterns are designed to have the balls move within the parameters randomly via the x and y axis.

The starter code was provided by MIT xPro.

## How to Run

The balls will begin to move and bounce upon opening of the web browser window. There are not any additional instructions or steps for the user in order to run this program.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Future improvements will include having the balls change to random colors each time they bounce off the parameter walls.
