# Random Bouncing Ball Exercise

## Description

In this exercise, there is a progression of my JavaScript skills as I created a boundry for three separate balls to bounce independently at different speeds and at random angles. The movement patterns had to be designed to move within the parameters within the x and y axis.

The starter code was provided by MIT xPro.
